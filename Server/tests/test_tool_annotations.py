"""Annotation guard: every MCP tool must state its safety hints explicitly.

MCP clients gate a tool behind a human approval prompt when it is not read-only
and not explicitly non-destructive. ``destructiveHint`` defaults to *true* when
omitted, so forgetting it is the dangerous direction -- a harmless read gets an
approval prompt on every call.

That is exactly how #1288 happened: PR #480's own description claimed hints for
``read_console``, ``manage_editor`` and ``set_active_instance``, but the merged
diff set only ``title``. The spec default silently supplied ``destructiveHint:
true`` and nobody noticed for a year.

So this guard requires ``title`` and ``destructiveHint`` to be stated outright,
and pins the set of tools that are safe to auto-approve. ``readOnlyHint`` is not
required: omitting it means *false*, which is the safe direction and is already
correct for every tool that leaves it unset.
