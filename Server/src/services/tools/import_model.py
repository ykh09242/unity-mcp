"""
Defines the import_model tool for importing 3D models from the Sketchfab
marketplace into Unity.

Thin pass-through: this tool carries NO API keys and NO file bytes. The C# side
reads the user's Sketchfab token from the OS secure store, performs the search /
download, and imports the model into the Unity project.
