"""
Defines the generate_image tool for AI 2D image generation in Unity.

Thin pass-through: this tool carries NO API keys and NO file bytes. The C# side
reads the user's provider key from the OS secure store, performs the provider
HTTPS call, downloads/decodes the result, and imports it as a texture.
