# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, email **security@coplay.dev** with:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- The version of MCP for Unity affected (UPM package + Python server)
- Your OS, Unity Editor version, and MCP client
- Optional: a suggested fix

We aim to acknowledge reports within **3 business days** and to share an initial assessment within **10 business days**. Critical fixes are released as patch versions on both `main` and the beta channel.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| latest (`main`) | Yes |
| latest beta (`beta`) | Yes |
| older releases | No — please upgrade |

## Network Defaults (Safe by Default)

MCP for Unity is intentionally fail-closed:

- **HTTP Local** binds to loopback only by default (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`). LAN bind (`0.0.0.0`, `::`) requires explicit opt-in via **Allow LAN Bind (HTTP Local)** in Advanced Settings.
- **HTTP Remote** requires `https://` by default. Plaintext `http://` for remote endpoints requires explicit opt-in via **Allow Insecure Remote HTTP**.
- Remote-hosted mode requires API key authentication. See [Remote Server Auth](https://coplaydev.github.io/unity-mcp/guides/remote-server-auth).

If you find a way to bypass any of these guards, that qualifies as a security vulnerability and warrants a private report.

## Resource and Data Safeguards

- Hosted plugin catalogs are scoped to the authenticated user. A WebSocket registers once; reconnecting uses a new socket. Limits are 32 sessions per user, 256 overall, and 256 tools / 512 KiB of tool metadata per plugin.
- API-key validation endpoints require HTTPS and do not follow redirects. Client configuration generation applies the same remote TLS policy as the Unity connection.
- Shader operations stay inside `Assets/`. Screenshot filenames cannot contain directories; their output folders must stay inside the project. These paths reject symbolic links and junctions.
- Caller-supplied Python regexes have a 0.1-second matching budget, 2,048-character patterns, 2,000,000-character input, and 10,000 matches. Script edit requests allow at most 32 edits. Search responses include at most 1,000 results, with 2,000-character match/excerpt fields.
- Provider API responses are limited to 32 MiB and artifact downloads to 512 MiB, including responses with missing or misleading size headers. Archives allow at most 4,096 entries, 256 MiB per entry, 1 GiB total uncompressed data, and a 200:1 compression ratio. Extraction checks actual streamed bytes and removes newly written files on failure.
- Optional command recording writes only execution metadata to `Library/MCPForUnity/Logs/`. Parameters, action values, and error text are excluded. Older logs under `Assets/UnityMCP/Log/` are not modified automatically.
- Batch commands enforce the same enabled-resource and enabled-tool settings as individual calls.

## What Counts as a Security Issue

- Remote code execution via crafted MCP messages
- Auth bypass on remote-hosted server
- Filesystem read/write outside the intended Unity project root
- Network requests that escape the configured allow-list
- Credential or API-key leakage in logs, telemetry, or error responses

## What Doesn't Count

- Tool actions that intentionally modify the Unity project (that's the product)
- Issues that require an attacker to already have shell access to the host
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies — please report those upstream first; we'll bump our pins after the upstream fix lands

## Disclosure Timeline

Once a fix is shipped, we publish a security advisory on the GitHub Security tab and credit the reporter (unless they prefer anonymity).
