# Unity MCP (ykh09242) - Documentation Site

Docusaurus 3.x documentation for the Git-only ykh09242 fork. No live fork deployment URL is established here. The default origin is local; set `WEBSITE_URL` to a verified deployment origin before publishing. The repository's retained release metadata and release bodies describe upstream CoplayDev history, not fork releases.

## Local development

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run start    # serves at http://localhost:3000/unity-mcp/
```

Edits to Markdown under `docs/` hot-reload.

## Build

```bash
npm run build    # outputs to website/build/
npm run serve    # serves the build for local verification
```

## Brand-neutral URL policy

URL slugs must NOT contain `mcp-for-unity` or `unity-mcp`. The brand name lives in `docusaurus.config.js` (`title`, `tagline`, navbar/footer copy). A future product rename should touch this file and content text — not URL paths. See the rename-proofing section of the plan.

## Adding a redirect when renaming a slug

Never rename a published slug without adding an entry to `plugin-client-redirects` in `docusaurus.config.js`. External backlinks must keep working.

## Tool reference (M3+)

Files under `docs/reference/tools/` and `docs/reference/resources/` are **generated** from the Python `@mcp_for_unity_tool` and `@mcp_for_unity_resource` registries by `tools/generate_docs_reference.py`. Do not hand-edit those files outside the `<!-- examples:start --><!-- examples:end -->` blocks — the generator will overwrite them.
