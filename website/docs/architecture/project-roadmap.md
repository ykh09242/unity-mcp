# Project Roadmap

> Upstream history: this page preserves CoplayDev/unity-mcp releases, plans, authorship, and references. Historical publisher services and install paths are not fork distribution claims. For current fork installation, see https://github.com/ykh09242/unity-mcp/blob/beta/website/docs/getting-started/install.md.

A living document outlining MCP for Unity's high-level goals, priorities, and planned features. It evolves with community feedback, technical discoveries, and shifting priorities.

For the deep-research **2026 Feature Roadmap** (per-tool API coverage analysis), see [Feature Roadmap 2026](/architecture/roadmap).

**Want to contribute or discuss?** See [How to Contribute or Provide Feedback](#how-to-contribute-or-provide-feedback).

## Overall Vision & Goals

The primary goal is to provide a robust, flexible, and easy-to-use bridge between the Unity Editor and external MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, and beyond).

Key objectives:

1. **Make onboarding effortless** — setting up the MCP server is a known pain point for the ecosystem and this project; we'll make it easier to get started.
2. **Improve speed & efficiency** — reduce latency and token usage for faster workflows.
3. **Expand integrations** — more MCP clients, better MCP server discovery, improved auth.
4. **Improve developer experience** — clean APIs, clearer docs, maintainable architecture.
5. **Align with real user needs** — prioritize community- and customer-driven improvements from feedback.

## Current Focus

Legend: **Feat** = feature, **Fix** = bug fix, **Imp** = improvement, **Doc** = docs, **Test** = tests, **Tech** = tech debt / refactor, **Arch** = architecture.

- **Doc** — Documentation overhaul to improve clarity, onboarding, and discoverability
- **Imp** — Per-call instance routing — target specific Unity instances on any tool call ([#772](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/pull/772))
- **Fix** — Code Coverage dependency guard for fresh installs ([#540](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/issues/540))

## Mid-Term Plans

Items aimed for further out. Details and priorities are less defined.

- **Feat** — Explore Runtime MCP Operation ([Discussion #781](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/discussions/781))
- **Feat** — Explore adding GenAI plugins for 2D and 3D assets ([Discussion #778](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/discussions/778))
- **Tech** — Re-evaluate script editing capabilities and consolidate

## Long-Term Ideas & Future Directions

Bigger ideas or major features further down the line (>6–9 months) or requiring significant research / design.

- **Arch** — Dependency Injection to improve testability
- **Feat** — Add more play mode functionality — support MCP during runtime with custom tools would let LLMs interact with user-created games / experiences

## Maybe / Icebox / Backlog

Suggested or considered but not currently planned. May be revisited later.

- Visual scripting integration (e.g., Bolt / PlayMaker)
- **Test** — Test coverage for Tools, networking, and ideally end-to-end
- **Imp** — Docker support for running the MCP server ([Discussion #776](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/discussions/776))
- **Imp** — Tool search / tool filtering to reduce context ([Discussion #777](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/discussions/777))

## Recently Completed

- **Feat** — Per-call `unity_instance` routing via tool arguments ([#772](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/pull/772)) — supersedes CLI flags approach
- **Feat** — HTTP Server Authentication ([#433](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/issues/433))
- **Feat** — Flag to make custom tools available globally or by project ([#416](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/issues/416))
- **Fix** — High resource costs when not in use ([#577](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/issues/577))
- **Imp** — Use MCP for Unity via the CLI ([#544](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/pull/544))
- **Imp** — OpenCode Support ([#498](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/pull/498))
