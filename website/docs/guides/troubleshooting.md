# Common Setup Problems

## macOS: Claude CLI fails to start (dyld ICU library not loaded)

**Symptoms:**
- MCP for Unity error: *"Failed to start Claude CLI. dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicui18n.71.dylib …"*
- Running `claude` in Terminal fails with missing `libicui18n.xx.dylib`.

**Cause:**
Homebrew Node (or the `claude` binary) was linked against an ICU version that's no longer installed; dyld can't find that dylib.

**Fix options (pick one):**

**Reinstall Homebrew Node** (relinks to current ICU), then reinstall CLI:

```bash
brew update
brew reinstall node
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Use NVM Node** (avoids Homebrew ICU churn):

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
# Unity MCP → Claude Code → Choose Claude Location → ~/.nvm/versions/node/<ver>/bin/claude
```

**Use the native installer** (puts `claude` in a stable path):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
# Unity MCP → Claude Code → Choose Claude Location → /opt/homebrew/bin/claude or ~/.local/bin/claude
```

**After fixing:** in MCP for Unity (Claude Code section), click **"Choose Claude Location"** and select the working `claude` binary, then **Register** again.

## WSL2: Connecting Claude Code (Linux) to Unity (Windows)

If you're running Claude Code from WSL2 and Unity on Windows, the MCP server runs on the Windows side but Claude Code needs to reach it from WSL. Here's how to bridge the two.

*Contributed by [@aollivier82](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/issues/712).*

### 1. Install the Unity package

In Unity Package Manager, add by git URL:

```text
https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp.git?path=/MCPForUnity#main
```

In the MCP for Unity settings, change the port to **8090** (or any free port — the default 8080 can conflict with other services like Tailscale).

### 2. Install uv on Windows

The MCP server requires `uv`. From an admin PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

### 3. Set up port forwarding from WSL to Windows

WSL2 runs in a separate network namespace, so you need to forward the MCP port. From an admin PowerShell:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8090 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=8090 connectaddress=127.0.0.1
```

Then add a firewall rule to allow it:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Unity MCP Server" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 8090 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

### 4. Find your WSL host IP

From inside WSL:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'
```

This prints the Windows host IP as seen from WSL (e.g. `172.21.48.1`). It's a private address that varies per machine.

### 5. Add the MCP server to Claude Code

From WSL, using the IP from step 4:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http UnityMCP http://<YOUR_WSL_HOST_IP>:8090/mcp
```

For example:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http UnityMCP http://172.21.48.1:8090/mcp
```

Note: this uses **HTTP transport**, not stdio — since the server is running on the Windows side.

### 6. Verify

Start Unity, then start Claude Code. You should see `UnityMCP` listed as a connected MCP server. Test it by asking Claude to get your scene info.

**Notes:**
- If you restart your machine, the WSL host IP may change. Re-run step 4 and update the MCP config if needed.
- The port proxy persists across reboots. To remove it later: `netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=8090 listenaddress=0.0.0.0`
- If the connection fails, make sure Unity is running and the MCP server is started (check the MCP for Unity panel).

## DLL reference mismatch with Unity AI Assistant package

If you're using **Unity 6.3+** alongside the **Unity AI Assistant** package, you may encounter `System.Collections.Immutable` version conflicts.

*Reported by [@rkroska](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/issues/557).*

**Symptoms:**
- Compilation errors referencing `System.Collections.Immutable` version mismatches
- Errors appear after installing MCP for Unity in a project that has the Unity AI Assistant package

**Cause:**
Unity AI Assistant bundles `System.Collections.Immutable` v10, while MCP for Unity's CodeAnalysis dependency needs v9. Unity's built-in version may be v8. These conflict during assembly resolution.

**Fix options:**

- **Option A (recommended):** If you don't need Unity AI Assistant, remove it via Package Manager. Then install `System.Collections.Immutable` v9.0.0 as a DLL in `Assets/Plugins/`.
- **Option B:** If you need both packages, install `System.Collections.Immutable` v9.0.0 in `Assets/Plugins/` to satisfy MCP's dependency. The AI Assistant's v10 reference should be forward-compatible.

**Note:** This is a Unity assembly resolution issue, not specific to MCP for Unity. Unity doesn't have a NuGet-style dependency resolver, so DLL version conflicts must be resolved manually.

## Unity 6.5: Editor hangs on load and the bridge never connects

If Unity 6000.5.x spins at ~100% CPU on startup and never opens the Editor window, check `Packages/manifest.json` for `com.unity.ai.assistant` (and `com.unity.ai.inference`, `com.unity.asset-manager-for-unity`).

**Symptoms:**
- The Editor never finishes loading, so MCP for Unity never arms its bridge — which looks like an MCP connection failure
- Stack traces sit inside `AssetDatabase::InitialRefresh` → `SourceAssetScanner::Refresh` → `GuidDB::ValidateChangedGUIDs`

**Cause:**
The pre-release AI packages can livelock `AssetDatabase::InitialRefresh`. This happens before any MCP for Unity assembly is loaded, so no MCP code is involved.

**Fix:** remove those packages from `manifest.json`, **delete `Packages/packages-lock.json`** (it re-resolves them otherwise), then clear `Library/`. Disabling the package is not enough — the AI packages re-add each other.

This is a Unity bug (UUM-132096), not an MCP for Unity one.

*Reported by [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/issues/1219).*

## Package Manager: "Error when executing git command" / "not in a git directory"

Adding the package from a Git URL makes the Package Manager shell out to `git`. Two things make that fail:

1. **git is not installed or not on PATH.** Install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and restart Unity so the Editor picks up the new PATH. The setup window (**Window → MCP for Unity → Local Setup Window**) shows a **Git (optional)** row so you can confirm the Editor sees it.
2. **git refuses the folder.** Newer git versions decline to run inside a directory owned by a different user account (external drives, shared folders, projects created by another account). The Package Manager surfaces this as `fatal: not in a git directory`. Tell git the folder is yours:

```bash
# trust this one project
git config --global --add safe.directory "/path/to/the/unity/project"

# or trust every repository under a folder — the trailing /* is required
git config --global --add safe.directory "/path/to/the/parent/folder/*"
```

A plain directory path only trusts that exact repository; the `/*` suffix is what extends it to the repositories underneath. Restart Unity and add the package again.

Git is only needed for this install path; the bridge itself does not use it, so a missing git never blocks setup.

## Codex: `resources/read failed: unknown MCP server`

The `mcpforunity://` URI names the *resource*, not the server. Some clients take a separate server key on a resource read.

In Codex, tools are exposed as `mcp__unityMCP__*`, but `resources/read` wants the discovery key on its own:

```
server: "unityMCP"
uri: "mcpforunity://custom-tools"
```

If a read fails with an unknown-server error, list resources first and use the key exactly as returned.

## "No Unity Instances Found"

:::tip When in doubt, restart your client
Clients like Claude Code or JetBrains Rider can get confused if you switch transport modes mid-session. Restart the client so it picks up the new configuration.
:::

If restarting doesn't fix it:
- Check the MCP for Unity status panel — does it say `Connected`?
- Open `mcpforunity://instances` in your client. If it returns an empty list, the Unity-side bridge isn't running.
- Try **Window → MCP for Unity → Restart Server**.

## Unity takes focus while tests are running

The server may briefly focus Unity when a running test has not reported progress,
to help editors throttled in the background. To disable this behavior, set
`UNITY_MCP_DISABLE_FOCUS_NUDGE=1` in the environment of the **Python MCP server**
and restart that server. For a stdio client, add it to the server's `env` entry;
for HTTP, set it in the environment that launches the shared server. The values
`true`, `yes`, and `on` also disable nudges. Forced nudges respect this setting.

On Windows, the nudge now requires an absolute project path matching exactly one
running `Unity.exe` process. Stdio sessions resolve that path from the selected
instance's registry entry. If the path cannot be resolved, it skips activation.
It restores the previous window by its saved HWND,
so a changing window title does not prevent focus restoration. Windows can still
deny an activation request, in which case the server reports failure.

For [#1407](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/issues/1407), the server now skips
nudges when the editor reports `run_in_background: true`. Otherwise, each test
job has a budget of three attempts without newer test progress. Both immediate
polls and `wait_timeout` polls share that budget, and only one nudge runs at a
time per server. Each attempt uses the configured focus duration instead of
escalating the duration after repeated polls.

When the budget is exhausted, `get_test_job` reports
`progress.stuck_suspected: true` and
`progress.focus_nudge_status: "attempt_limit_reached"`. The test itself keeps
running; the server stops taking focus. Newer test progress renews that job's
budget, while older replies cannot renew it. Older Unity packages that do not
report `run_in_background` still use the bounded attempts.

Budgets belong to the running Python server and expire after an hour without a
poll; separate stdio server processes maintain separate budgets. Disable nudges
entirely when background tests already run reliably.

## FAQ — Claude Code

**Q: Unity can't find `claude` even though Terminal can.**
A: macOS apps launched from Finder / Hub don't inherit your shell PATH. In the MCP for Unity window, click **"Choose Claude Location"** and select the absolute path (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude` or `~/.nvm/versions/node/<ver>/bin/claude`).

**Q: I installed via NVM; where is `claude`?**
A: Typically `~/.nvm/versions/node/<ver>/bin/claude`. The MCP for Unity UI also scans NVM versions and you can browse to it via **"Choose Claude Location"**.

**Q: The Register button says "Claude Not Found".**
A: Install the CLI or set the path. Click the orange **[HELP]** link in the MCP for Unity window for step-by-step install instructions, then choose the binary location. See also: [Install or Repair Claude Code CLI](/guides/claude-code-cli).

## FAQ — VS Code

**Q: When I first set up and start the MCP for Unity server in VS Code, I get a failed response that says `Canceled: Canceled`.**
A: Start a new chat — the bad chat didn't pick up the MCP server configuration.

![Canceled error screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/571e2aeb-c286-4235-ab2b-8285c0db3296)

## FAQ — Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code (Windows uv path)

**Q: My MCP client keeps failing to launch the server even though `uv` is installed.**
A: Some Windows machines have multiple `uv.exe` locations. Auto-config sometimes picks a less stable path, causing the launch to fail or auto-rewrite on every restart. Use **"Choose UV Install Location"** in the MCP for Unity window and pin the **WinGet Links shim** path (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Links\uv.exe`) — it's stable across uv upgrades.
