# Install or Repair uv + Python

The key to configuring MCP with **Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, and Rider is [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**.

- `uv` is a fast Python package manager used to install and run the Unity MCP Server (`mcp-for-unity`).
- **How it's used:** your MCP client config points to `command: uvx` with args like `--python ">=3.11" --from "<mcpServerSource>" mcp-for-unity --transport stdio`. Replace `<mcpServerSource>` with the full-commit GitHub archive URL from the installed Unity package's `package.json`; see [installation](../getting-started/install.md). The client invokes `uvx` directly to launch the server without a Git checkout. Git is still needed for the Unity Package Manager Git installation.
- **Why it matters:** if `uv` isn't installed or on PATH, Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code can't start the server. The Unity MCP (ykh09242) window will show **"uv Not Found"** until fixed.
- **Detection / override:** the Unity MCP (ykh09242) window auto-detects `uv` in common locations and on PATH. If not found, use **"Choose UV Install Location"** to navigate to your `uv` binary and save the path.

:::tip When in doubt, restart your client
Clients like Claude Code or JetBrains Rider can get confused if you switch from `http` to `stdio` (or vice versa). If they say **"No Unity Instances found"**, restart the client so it picks up the new configuration.

## Requirements

You need **Python 3.11+** and the **`uv`** package manager. Starting with fork release **1.1.4**, Python 3.10 is no longer supported. Generated launch commands request a compatible interpreter explicitly.

### Verify

```bash
python3 --version   # should be 3.11+
uv --version        # should print a version like "uv 0.x"
```

## Install Python

With uv already installed, `uv python install 3.11` installs the minimum supported interpreter. After updating the Unity package, regenerate existing stdio client configurations so they use the new server source and Python request. Custom commands that explicitly select Python 3.10 must be updated; do not patch `enum` or change unrelated environment variables to work around `StrEnum` import errors.

**macOS:**

```bash
# Option A: Official installer (recommended)
# Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Option B: Homebrew example (choose a Python version supported by this project)
brew install python@3.12
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
# Official installer (recommended)
# Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
```

## Install uv

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or Homebrew on macOS
brew install uv
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
# or
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
```

## Common uv locations

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | `/opt/homebrew/bin/uv`, `/usr/local/bin/uv`, `~/.local/bin/uv` |
| **Linux** | `/usr/local/bin/uv`, `/usr/bin/uv`, `~/.local/bin/uv` |
| **Windows** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Programs/Python/Python3xx/Scripts/uv.exe` |

## Unity MCP (ykh09242) window behavior

- If `uv` isn't found, the status panel shows a red **"uv Not Found"** with a hint **"Make sure uv is installed! [CLICK]"**.
- Use **"Choose UV Install Location"** to browse to the `uv` binary. This saves the path and reconfigures automatically.
- On macOS, Unity launched from Finder may not inherit your PATH. Setting the `uv` location here is the easiest fix.

## Notes and gotchas

- **macOS GUI apps don't inherit your shell startup files.** PATH may differ from Terminal. Set `uv` via the MCP window to avoid PATH issues.
- **Windows vs WSL:** if you installed `uv` inside WSL only, Windows-native Unity can't see it. Install `uv` on Windows, or use the MCP window to point to a Windows `uv.exe`.
- **Custom locations:** if you installed `uv` somewhere non-standard, the picker path is stored in `UnityMCP.UvPath` and persists across sessions.

## What the "Repair Python Env" button does

- Deletes the server's `.venv` and `.python-version` (if present)
- Runs `uv sync` in the Unity MCP Server `src` directory to rebuild a clean environment
- Useful after Python upgrades or missing modules

## Where the Unity MCP Server is installed

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src` (or `~/Library/AppSupport/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src` via symlink) |
| **Windows** | `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src` |
| **Linux** | `~/.local/share/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src` |

## Manual repair / run

```bash
cd <UnityMcpServer/src>
uv sync
uv run server.py
```
