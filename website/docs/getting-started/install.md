# Install

Unity MCP (ykh09242) is a Git-only fork of CoplayDev/unity-mcp. Install the Unity package from this fork and use its pinned Git server source. No fork Asset Store, OpenUPM, or PyPI distribution is advertised.

## Prerequisites

- **Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer** — [Download Unity](https://unity.com/download)
- **Python 3.10+** with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) — the setup wizard guides you through both if missing
- **An MCP client** — [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [VS Code Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview), [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/), [Cline](https://cline.bot/), [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), and more

## Git URL

If the original `com.coplaydev.unity-mcp` package is already installed, remove it in Package Manager before adding this fork. Both packages retain the same assembly names and asset GUIDs and must not coexist. Reconfigure your MCP clients after installation so they use the fork's pinned server source.

This path needs `git` on your PATH (the Package Manager runs it). If it reports `Error when executing git command`, see [troubleshooting](../guides/troubleshooting.md#package-manager-error-when-executing-git-command--not-in-a-git-directory).

In Unity, open **Window → Package Manager**, click the **`+`** button, choose **Add package from git URL...**, and paste:

```text
https://github.com/ykh09242/unity-mcp.git?path=/MCPForUnity#ykh09242-v1.0.0
```

`ykh09242-v1.0.0` identifies the stable `1.0.0` fork release. The prefix separates [Fork Releases](https://github.com/ykh09242/unity-mcp/releases) from inherited upstream tags. Fork component versions follow their own SemVer series, independently of upstream versions. Use a full commit SHA instead of a tag for immutable installation. The UPM name is `com.ykh09242.unity-mcp`.

For development only, replace the tag with `#beta` to follow the moving source branch. The branch name does not make a tagged GitHub release a prerelease.

The Unity package's `mcpServerSource` field in [`MCPForUnity/package.json`](https://github.com/ykh09242/unity-mcp/blob/beta/MCPForUnity/package.json) specifies the immutable Git URL for the matching Python distribution, `ykh09242-unity-mcp-server`. Use that value for `uvx --from`; executable names remain `mcp-for-unity` and `unity-mcp`. See the [server guide](https://github.com/ykh09242/unity-mcp/blob/beta/Server/README.md).

## Start the server and connect

After import, MCP for Unity opens a **setup wizard** automatically.

1. Confirm Python and `uv` are installed — the wizard guides you through both if missing.
2. Click **Done**. Once dependencies are green, a list of MCP clients detected on your machine appears.
3. Pick the clients you want to configure and click **Configure Selected**.

You can return to this UI anytime via **Window → Unity MCP (ykh09242)** to start/stop the server, switch transport (HTTP vs stdio), or reconfigure clients. The status panel reads `Connected` when everything is wired up.

### First prompt

Try one of these in your MCP client:

> Create a red, blue, and yellow cube in the current scene.

> Build a simple player controller with WASD movement and a double-jump.

> List every script in `Assets/Scripts` and tell me which ones reference `Rigidbody`.

## Per-client notes

- **Claude Desktop** only supports stdio. MCP for Unity will silently configure it that way even if you have HTTP selected elsewhere.
- **Cursor, Antigravity, OpenClaw** still require enabling an MCP toggle or plugin in their own settings after auto-configuration.
- **OpenClaw** also needs the `openclaw-mcp-bridge` plugin enabled and follows the currently selected MCP for Unity transport.
- **Claude Code, VS Code, Windsurf, Cline, and the CLI clients** auto-connect after configuration.

Detailed per-client setup lives in the [MCP Client Configurators guide](/guides/client-configurators).

## Manual MCP client configuration

If auto-configuration doesn't work for your client, add this to your client's MCP config file. In the stdio examples, replace `<mcpServerSource>` with the exact value from the installed package's `package.json` before running. For local HTTP, start the server before configuring clients; include the current launch token from its private token file.

### HTTP (default — Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, VS Code, Cline, etc.)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unityMCP": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-Unity-MCP-Token": "<current launch token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "unityMCP": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-Unity-MCP-Token": "<current launch token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Stdio (Claude Desktop, or any client without HTTP)

**macOS / Linux:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unityMCP": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "<mcpServerSource>", "mcp-for-unity", "--transport", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unityMCP": {
      "command": "C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WinGet/Links/uvx.exe",
      "args": ["--from", "<mcpServerSource>", "mcp-for-unity", "--transport", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Unity Bridge not connecting** — Open **Window → Unity MCP (ykh09242)** and check the status panel. Restart Unity if needed.
- **Server not starting** — Verify `uv --version` works in your terminal. Check the MCP for Unity log for errors.
- **Client not connecting** — Confirm the HTTP server is running on `localhost:8080` and the URL in your client config matches.

For runtime and client setup, see [uv setup](../guides/uv-setup.md) and [troubleshooting](../guides/troubleshooting.md).
