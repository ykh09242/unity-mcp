# CLI Reference

Replace `<mcpServerSource>` in the examples with the immutable Git URL from the installed Unity package's `package.json`. See [fork installation](/getting-started/install); this fork is not installed from PyPI.

The `mcp-for-unity` CLI is a developer-facing terminal for the same Unity automations the MCP tools expose. Both invoke the same C# `HandleCommand` methods on the Unity side — see [Three-Layer Python Design](/architecture/python-layers) for why both layers exist.

## Invocation

```bash
# Run via uvx (no install)
uvx --from "<mcpServerSource>" mcp-for-unity <command> [args]

# Run from a Server checkout
cd Server && uv run mcp-for-unity <command> [args]

# Run via the dedicated CLI entry point (alias)
uvx --from "<mcpServerSource>" unity-mcp <command> [args]
```

## How it talks to Unity

The CLI uses **HTTP** to the Python server (default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`), regardless of how your MCP clients are configured. The Python server in turn talks to the connected Unity Editor via WebSocket. MCP tools take a similar path via WebSocket directly; CLI commands take HTTP.

## Global flags

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Python server host to connect to |
| `--port` | `8080` | Python server port |
| `--instance` | (auto) | Target Unity instance (`Name@hash`, hash prefix, or port number) |
| `--format` | `text` | Output format: `text` or `json` |
| `--verbose / -v` | off | Print full request/response payloads |
| `--version` | — | Print CLI version and exit |
| `--help` | — | Show command help |

For multi-instance setups, see [Multi-Instance Routing](/guides/multi-instance).

## Command groups

The CLI mirrors the MCP tool catalog. Each command group wraps one or more `manage_*` tools.

## Discovering subcommands and flags

Every group supports `--help`:

```bash
mcp-for-unity scene --help
mcp-for-unity scene load --help
```

The help text is the authoritative per-command reference — flags, choices, and defaults all live there because the CLI is built on Click and self-describes.

## Examples

See [CLI Examples](/guides/cli-examples) for end-to-end walkthroughs and the [CLI Usage Guide](/guides/cli) for narrative context (when to use the CLI vs an MCP client).
