## Description

Import a local 3D model file that already exists within the Unity project's Assets folder (e.g. an FBX/OBJ/glTF exported from Blender or another DCC tool) into the Unity project. The file is copied under Assets/ and run through Unity's model-import pipeline (scale-normalize, material settings; glTF requires glTFast). Carries no API keys and no file bytes over the bridge.

Params: source_path (Assets-relative path, or an absolute path physically within this Unity project's Assets, to a .fbx/.obj/.glb/.gltf/.zip; traversal and symbolic links/junctions are rejected), name, output_folder (under Assets/), target_size, animation_type. Returns { asset_path, asset_guid }.

animation_type (FBX/OBJ only): pass 'generic' or 'humanoid' for a rigged/animated mesh so Unity surfaces its AnimationClips; omitted or 'none' imports no rig (this is the usual cause of a rigged FBX importing with zero clips); 'legacy' selects Unity's legacy Animation system (rarely needed). glTF/GLB ignore it — glTFast imports animation itself.

For multi-file exports (a text .gltf with an external .bin, or an .obj with a sibling .mtl/textures), zip them and pass the .zip — a bare .gltf/.obj is copied without its sidecars.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `source_path` | `str` | yes | Assets-relative or absolute-within-Assets model file path (.fbx/.obj/.glb/.gltf/.zip). |
| `name` | `str \| None` | — | Base name for the imported asset. |
| `output_folder` | `str \| None` | — | Destination folder under Assets/ for the import. |
| `target_size` | `float \| None` | — | Normalize the largest dimension to this size (meters). |
| `animation_type` | `Literal['none', 'generic', 'humanoid', 'legacy'] \| None` | — | FBX/OBJ only: rig/animation import mode. 'generic' or 'humanoid' surface the model's AnimationClips; 'legacy' selects Unity's legacy Animation system (rarely needed); omitted or 'none' imports no rig. Ignored for glTF/GLB. |

## Returns

A `dict` containing the Unity response. The exact shape depends on the action.
