# Tool reference

> **Auto-generated** from the Python tool registry. Do not hand-edit outside `<!-- examples:start --><!-- examples:end -->` blocks — the generator (`tools/generate_docs_reference.py`) will overwrite them.

Every tool MCP for Unity exposes, generated directly from the Python `@mcp_for_unity_tool` registry under `Server/src/services/tools/`.
