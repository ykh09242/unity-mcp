# `run_tests`

> **Auto-generated** from the Python tool registry. Do not hand-edit outside `<!-- examples:start --><!-- examples:end -->` blocks — the generator (`tools/generate_docs_reference.py`) will overwrite them.

**Group:** `testing` &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Module:** `services.tools.run_tests`

## Description

Starts a Unity test run asynchronously and returns a job_id immediately. Poll with get_test_job for progress.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `mode` | `Literal['EditMode', 'PlayMode']` | — | Unity test mode to run |
| `test_names` | `list[str] \| str \| None` | — | Full names of specific tests to run |
| `group_names` | `list[str] \| str \| None` | — | Same as test_names, except it allows for Regex |
| `category_names` | `list[str] \| str \| None` | — | NUnit category names to filter by |
| `assembly_names` | `list[str] \| str \| None` | — | Assembly names to filter tests by |
| `include_failed_tests` | `bool` | — | Include details for failed/skipped tests only (default: false) |
| `include_details` | `bool` | — | Include details for all tests (default: false) |
| `init_timeout` | `int \| None` | — | Initialization timeout in milliseconds (1..2147483647). PlayMode tests may need longer due to domain reload (default: 15000). Recommended: 120000 for PlayMode. |
| `clear_stuck` | `bool` | — | Clear an orphaned running job instead of starting a run. Use when a job was lost to a domain reload and is blocking every subsequent run. |

## Returns

A `dict` containing the Unity response. The exact shape depends on the action.

## Examples

<!-- examples:start -->
### Run every EditMode test

> Run all EditMode tests and tell me what failed.

```json
{
  "mode": "EditMode",
  "include_failed_tests": true
}
```

Returns immediately with a `job_id` and `status: "running"`. Poll it with [`get_test_job`](./get_test_job.md) — the results are not in this response.

### Run specific tests by full name

> Re-run only `InventoryTests.AddItem_IncreasesCount`.

```json
{
  "mode": "EditMode",
  "test_names": ["MyGame.Tests.InventoryTests.AddItem_IncreasesCount"],
  "include_failed_tests": true
}
```

`test_names` must be full names (namespace, class, method). A single string is accepted as well as a list.

### Run a whole namespace with a regex

> Run every test under `MyGame.Tests.Inventory`.

```json
{
  "mode": "EditMode",
  "group_names": ["^MyGame\\.Tests\\.Inventory"]
}
```

Each `group_names` entry is a regular expression matched against the full test name, not a name that has to match exactly. Filters can be combined with `category_names` and `assembly_names`.

### Run PlayMode tests from one assembly

> Run the PlayMode tests in `MyGame.PlayModeTests`.

```json
{
  "mode": "PlayMode",
  "assembly_names": ["MyGame.PlayModeTests"],
  "init_timeout": 120000
}
```

PlayMode runs start with a domain reload, so the default 15 s `init_timeout` is often too short. 120000 ms is the recommended value.

### Unblock a run lost to a domain reload

> Every `run_tests` call fails because an old job is still marked as running.

```json
{
  "clear_stuck": true
}
```

Only clears the orphaned job; it does not start a run. The response says `Stuck job cleared.` or `No running job to clear.` Start the run again afterwards. `clear_stuck` does not check whether the job is still alive: it marks any job in the `running` state as failed. If a run is really in progress, `run_tests` answers `tests_running` with `retry_after_ms`; wait for it instead, because clearing it does not stop the tests already running in Unity.
